Workshop Agenda: Generative AI Application Integration
Gen AI Fundamentals
Introduction to Generative AI: Core models (LLMs, multimodal), use cases, challenges

Ethics and Responsible AI: Safety, bias mitigation, and deployment standards

Practical API Usage
Interacting with GenAI APIs: Workflow using REST APIs and SDKs

OpenAI Chat Completions: Messaging formats, role definitions, prompt and context management

Other provider APIs: Key features, authentication, payload design, error handling

Prompt Engineering
Designing effective prompts, templates, systematic context engineering

Modulating responses for specific business scenarios

Agentic Architectures and Frameworks
Agents: What, why, examples, orchestration

Agent Development Kit (ADK): Building modular and multi-agent systems, interoperability

Langchain Fundamentals: Toolchains, chaining models, integration with APIs and knowledge sources

LangGraph & Agent-to-Agent (A2A) Protocols: Multi-agent conversation, distributed reasoning, and enterprise patterns

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
Essentials of RAG: Architecture, retrieval vs generative phases, reliability improvements

Designing and Deploying RAG Pipelines: Search, indexing, hybrid data augmentation

Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP Overview: Context management, multi-tool/agent orchestration

Real-World MCP Integration: Example workflows, shared memory, tool/server construction

Hands-On Practicals
Chatbot implementation using any GenAI provider (OpenAI, AWS, Google, Azure, etc.)

Multi-agent demo (ADK, Langchain, LangGraph) for workflow automation

Building a small-scale RAG application for internal documentation retrieval

MCP-enabled agent orchestration across APIs/providers
